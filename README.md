# OHDM Offline Viewer
This project shall serve as a first prototype to display [Open Historical Data Maps](http://www.ohdm.net/) offline.

## Goal of this project
The goal of this repository is to be to render [Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.de/), without the need of a network connection.
To avoid caching dozens of different zoom layers, vector tiles are being used. 

## Technical realization
This project contains an android application, which renders ```.map-files```.
Those files can be obtained either via an integrated FTP Service, or by manual storing the corresponding file(s) in the file system of the device. 
For more information see the documentation.
