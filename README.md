# OHDM Offline Viewer
This project shall server as a first prototype to display [Open Historical Data Maps](http://www.ohdm.net/) offline

## Goal of this project
The goal of this reposiory is to be able to render OHDM files, without the need of a network connection.
Furthermore, for rendering map-files vector tiles should be used. 
Therefore there is no need of caching and storing a variety of different zoom layer for navigating through a map.


## Technical realization
This project contains an android application, which displays ```.map-files```.
```.map-files``` can be obtained either via an integrated FTP Service, or by manual storing the corresponding file(s) in the file system of the device.
